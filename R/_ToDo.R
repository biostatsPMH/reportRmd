# To Do

# testing all the rm_uvsum2 models -- DONE (results are in a spreadsheet)

# trying to get the rm_mvsum2 up and running -- DONE except extra rows for interaction terms

# test weird things in all the function and add nice error messages if we don't have them

# tidy code, so that we don't have extra print statements -- DONE

# move the functions that we aren't using to a new R file _unusedFunctions.R - maybe we will use them for better CIs at some point (-- which coeffSum functions are not being used?)

# run the Build > Check and try to resolve the errors and warnings -- STUCK

# go to the beach or the forest :-)
