\usage{
order_forest_data(tab)
}
\arguments{
\item{tab}{data frame prepared by prepare_forest_data}
}
\description{
Orders variables by their maximum estimate (descending) and levels within
variables by their original order, with reference levels first.
}
\details{
When both Adjusted and Unadjusted rows are present, ordering is determined
by the Adjusted estimates. When only Unadjusted rows are present (e.g., from
forestplotUV), ordering uses those estimates directly.
