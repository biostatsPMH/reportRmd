\title{Extract Function and Package Information from Current Document}
\usage{
extract_package_details()
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{package_name}{Character. Name of the package}
\item{functions_called}{Character. Comma-separated list of functions called from this package}
\item{package_version}{Character. Version number of the installed package}
\item{package_citation}{Character. Formatted citation for the package}
}
}
\description{
The function automatically detects the current R script file
(works best in RStudio), parses the code to identify function calls,
determines which packages they belong to, and creates a summary of all
non-base R packages used in the script. It handles both namespace-qualified
function calls (e.g., \code{dplyr::filter}) and regular function calls, while
filtering out base R functions and control structures.
}
\details{
This function analyses the current file (an R script, Rmd or qmd file) to
extract information about all functions called within the code, identifies
their associated packages, and returns a summary of packages used with
version and citation information.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Works best when run from RStudio with an active source file
\item Requires that referenced packages are already loaded/installed
\item Will not detect functions called through indirect methods (e.g., \code{do.call()})
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run this function from within an R script to analyze its dependencies
package_info <- extract_package_details()
print(package_info)
